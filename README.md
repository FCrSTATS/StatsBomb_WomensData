# StatsBomb Women's Data

Statsbomb have recently launched itself as a data provider of event data, it's an exciting release and certainly enters the market from the off as highly competitive to Opta and others. All of the Statsbomb staff seemed to have started their careers in football analytics as a hobby via personal blogs and the Statsbomb blog itself. They know too well that access to data is one of the biggest barriers to getting involved in this fast-growing hobby and profession. So it's great to see Ted, Thom and others opening the castle gates to others instead of gleefully teasing from the turrets as they announce free data! 

Statsbomb have made an initial release of 9 matches of their data, what makes it better is that the data is from women's football. Making it a double good deed, free data and encouraging the development and exposure of the women's game. 

This git repo will explore this free data source as we attempt to help others learn data science and football analytics.
